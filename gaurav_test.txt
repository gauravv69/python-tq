1. Explain Operators in Python
-> There are several operators used in python, which are Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, Assignment Operators.
   a. Arithmetic Operator: It's used for a basic math operations.
	                   eg: +, -, *, **, /, //, %
   b. Logical Operator: It's used for combining bollean expressions.
			   eg: and, or, not
   c. Relational Operator: These operator are used for comparing values.
			   eg: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
   d. Assignment Operator: They are used to assign or update values.
			   eg: =, +=, -=, etc.
                     


2. Explain use of break, continue & pass
-> break: It exits the loop completely
   continue: It skips to the next iteration of the loop
   pass: It does nothing, like it's a placeholder 



3. write syntax of while & for in loop in python
-> # Syntax for while loop
     i = 1
     while i <= 5:
	print(i)
	i++
   # Syntax for "for" loop
     for i in range(1,6):
	print(i)



4. WAP to accept the number & check number is Armstrong number or not
-> num = int(input("Enter a number"))
   sum = 0 
   
   while i > 0:
	digit = i % 10
	sum += digit**3
	i//=10
  
  if sum == num:
	print("Armstrong Number")
  else:
	print("Not an Armstrong Number")
	
   

5. WAP to accept the number & check number is palindrome or not 
-> num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   reverse = int(str(num)[::-1])

   if num == reverse:
	print("The number is palindrome")
   else:
	print("Number isn't palindrome")
